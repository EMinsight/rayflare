Theory & background
====================================================

A detailed look at the motivation, implementation, mathematics etc. behind
RayFlare can be found :download:`here <RayFlare_theory.pdf>`. This includes an
explanation of the ray-tracing algorithm, ray-tracing with integrated TMM,
the implementation of the matrix framework and how it is used to calculate useful
quantities such as absorption per layer and absorption profiles, and several
examples to validate the matrix framework with different combinations of methods
for the front and back surface.
