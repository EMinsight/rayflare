Open-source, integrated optical modelling of complex stacks

The aim of RayFlare is to provide a flexible, user-friendly Python environment to model complex optical stacks, with a focus on solar cells. 

*Note to new visitors from PVSC:* I am hard at work adding functionality and documentation! In the mean time, I appreciate any comments and feedback.
